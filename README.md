# UCSMDE Maneuver Operations

The purpose of the project is to integrate SAS with the UCSMDE framework for maneuvering operations including (but not limited to):

1. Zones (Keep in and Keep out zones)
2. Operational Mode
3. Behavior Translation

# Prerequisites

The JANUS project only utilizes Red Hat but CentOS will also work. In that case the user will have to ensure
that yum or dnf (if you prefer this package) are in working states.

**Please Ensure that your repos are setup correctly, include yum/dnf and pip**

# Requirements

The following dependencies can be obtained from the SIS repo:

- pyctoc
- py-caracas-behavior-msgs
- py-caracas-executive-msgs
- py-caracas-geometry-msgs
- py-caracas-navigation-msgs
- py-caracas-perception-msgs
- py-caracas-vehicle-msgs
- py-ctoc-transport-msgs
- sis-ucsmde-utilities

# Installation

The modules **should** be installed with python3.7 to ensure that asynchronous functionality is
up to date.

## Native

```bash
[sudo] pip3.7 install ucsmde-maneuver-operations
```

*NOTE: if you are installing the local package use `.` instead of the full package name.*

Add the following tag to update the package:
```bash
--upgrade
```

## Virtual Environment

```bash
python3.7 -m venv /dir/to/venv
```
This will create the Virtual environment.

```bash
source /dir/to/venv/activate
```
To activate your virtual environment that was just created. You may now install your package with`pip`.
